# Doctor Who's TARDIS OpenGL Project

This project modifies NeHe lesson 6 to create Doctor Who's TARDIS. In this modified version, the TARDIS is controllable using arrow keys for navigation.

## Description

This project utilizes OpenGL to render a 3D model of Doctor Who's TARDIS. The TARDIS can be maneuvered using the arrow keys on the keyboard. Pressing the left and right arrow keys rotates the TARDIS, allowing for navigation in different directions. Pressing the up arrow key enables the user to enter the TARDIS, while pressing the down arrow key allows the user to exit from it.

## Controls

- **Left Arrow Key**: Rotate the TARDIS counterclockwise.
- **Right Arrow Key**: Rotate the TARDIS clockwise.
- **Up Arrow Key**: Enter the TARDIS and play take-off sound.
- **Down Arrow Key**: Exit from the TARDIS and play landing sound.

## Getting Started

To run the program:

1. Ensure that your system supports OpenGL.
2. If the executable works unstable or runs too fast, try enabling V-sync.
3. Execute the provided executable file (lesson6.exe).
4. Use the arrow keys as described above to control the TARDIS.

## Files Included

- **lesson6.exe**: Executable file to run the program.
- **NeHe2.bmp**: Modified Texture file to use it on TARDIS Model.
- **takeoff.wav**: Take-off sound of the TARDIS.
- **landing.wav**: Landing sound of the TARDIS.
